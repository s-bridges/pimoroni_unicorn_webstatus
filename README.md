# pimoroni_unicorn_webstatus
A Python3 script to display on the 16x16 UnicornHD hat and provide status checks on a certain webpage.

This is perfect to run with a cron job. I have mine set to a webserver that I run. It provides a visual notice if there is something wrong with the webpage so that you can address it promptly.

No more webpages that have been down for multiple days!
