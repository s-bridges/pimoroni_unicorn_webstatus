# pimoroni_unicorn_webstatus
A Python3 script to display on the 16x16 UnicornHD hat and provide status checks on a certain webpage.

This is perfect to run with a cron job. I have mine set to a webserver that I run. It provides a visual notice if there is something wrong with the webpage so that you can address it promptly.

No more webpages that have been down for multiple days!

There have been questions about network lagging that can occur with this service running every so often. I have tested this out on multiple networks with varying download/upload speeds and have yet to see any degredation from this service running. If anyone returns different data, please mark an issue or contact me directly. :)
